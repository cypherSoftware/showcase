# Showcase
This is a some code from different projects during my time at the University of Arizona to show to potential Employers


This Showcase contains:

----------------------------------------------------------------------Web Design----------------------------------------------------------------------

  FinalProject.zip 
(This is the final project from my web design class.  It utilizes CSS, HTML, and JS.  A server was created using NodeJS and Express.  Several databases are utilized on the site using MongoDB. This site uses JSON, AJAX, and JQuery. This site has calendar event adding features where ICS files are saved into a database and downloadable to the user.  There is also searchable sermon, event, and member directory pages that utilize the MongoDB.  Some pages are only accessavle by members these pages are password protected and utilize login sessions for the members security.  The passwords are stored in the database using salting and Hashing algorithms.) 

  PApriceCo.zip
(A website from my web design class the shows a higher mastery of CSS concepts.  The user is able to click on three buttons to rearrange the Website CSS styles.  It focuses on object placement on the page using fixed, float, and absolute position commands.)

  PAWelcometotheJumble.zip
(A website from my web design class the shows the use of basic Javascript functions and AJAX requests to implement a ceasar cypher and a square cypher that updates in real time.)

  PA7Translator.zip
(A website from my web design class the demonstrates a basic server implementation on the back end and allows the user to type in type in a phrase in German, English, or Spanish and have it translated to any of those languages.  It interfaces with the server on the back end and searches a dictionary until finds the word and then translates it and sends the answer back to the user.  Grammer was not worried about in this project it was just to focus on server creation skills.)

  Chatty.zip
(A website from my web design class the highlights server interaction and database editing in real time.  Using MongoDB along with Express I created a simple chat platform the holds user names along with all there strings they sent held in a database which is queried every coupple of seconds and then the chat window is populated and updated as new chats are sent.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------Functional Programming------------------------------------------------------------

  HaskellPrograms.zip
(This file has several small programs written in Haskell to show understanding of functional programming.  The gcd file just finds the greatest common divisor using a recursive call.  The inserstion sort file is an insertion sort that adds to a list in O(n^2) time. The Vowels file just scans a string and pulls out all the vowls and saves them into a seperate string.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------C/Systems Programming--------------------------------------------------------------

  MyStrings.c
(This is a small c program that is essentially the strings program on linux that runs from terminal. It opens up a file and scans it looking for 3 characters or more strings and prints them out.  This program show the understanding of pointers and the fread(), fopen(), and seek functions.)

  OS system from scratch.zip
(This is some c files from a big semester long OS building project.  We used a skeleton of a fake OS called USLOSS that we had to add the meat too. There were 4 phases.  In phase 1 The students were required to start processes and implement a list of all the processes along with any pertinant info.  A dispatcher was also created to determine run time of each process.  Then functions were implemented to zap or kill and block the processes.  In Phase2 all inter process communication was implemented using a mailbox system.  Students had to make sure that all process worked well together and that the philosophers dininng problem didn't occur.  In Phase 3 the user interaction portion was implemented and a user could then make system calls.  This was layer that bridged kernal space to user space.  In the the last phase, Phase 4, the disk drivers were implements using a semephore system for control. The user was able to read and write to disk in the final phase. Note: These are just the main c files that the students implemented.  Without the full USLOSS program these ones can't be ran just viewed to see the coding quallity.)

  myMallocFunction.c 
(This was a from scratch of the malloc function from the c language.  The memory was allocated and tracked using a linked list to keep track of everything.  The different types of fits such as first fit, best fit and worst fit were implemented and can be tried.


----------------------------------------------------------------------C Programming and Cyber Security------------------------------------------------------

  DES.c
(This is an implementation of the DES encryption algorithm in the c programming language.  The focus point here was showing and understanding of a Fiestal Network, p-boxes, s-boxes, initial permutation, inverse permutation, bit masking, logical bitwise operators, and the different types of implementing block encryption such as the CTR and ECB methods.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------GO Programming Language--------------------------------------------------------------

  minsweeper.go
(This was a small project that I partnered up on with a friend in my comparative programming class.  We coded up a simple text based minsweeper app in the Go language to show basic Go understanding.)
